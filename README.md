# What is the SHA256 Hashing Algorithm? 
SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA).

The standard for the algorithm can be found [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf).

Here is a really usefull video I found which explains all the SHA algorithems:
