# What is the SHA256 Hashing Algorithm? 
SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA).

The standard for the algorithm can be found [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf).

Here is a really usefull video I found which explains all the SHA algorithems:

# How to Run
To run the script you need to have a c compiler installed unless you are on a linux machine.
 <br /> 
Personally I prefer Cygwin which can be downloaded from [here](https://cygwin.com/install.html).
 <br /> 
To install GCC [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47215330/how-do-i-install-gcc-on-cygwin) is a really handy stackoverflow post which goes through it.

Follow these steps to then run the script.

1. Clone this repo using 'git clone https://github.com/KeithH4666/SHA256ProjectTOA'
2. Go into the cloned dircetory and run the following commands:
3. Compile - 'gcc sha256 sha256.c'
4. Execute - 'sha256'
5. Enter a file when asked (Note unless the file is directly in the root folder of the application, the full file path is required)
